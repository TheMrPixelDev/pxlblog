title: A minimal web
---

My personal opinion is, that the internet should return to being more simple. Simple therefore doesn't have to mean less intuitive or secure, but with less impact on our planet and our privacy. The modern web is loaded with annoying scripts and styling that takes forever to download and render. That's especially true for older computers, and just one reason for this website to be so focused on minimalism.
