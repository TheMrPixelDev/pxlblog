## A minimal web

My personal opinion is, that the internet should return to be more simple. Simple therefore doesn\''t have to mean less intuitive or secure but with less impact on our planet and our privacy. The modern web is loaded with annoying scripts and styling that takes forever to download and render, especially for older computers. That's one reason for this website to be so focused on minimalism and purism.',
