title: Did I overestimate?
---

I feel bad. Why? 'Cause I feel some kind of jealousy I've never felt before. A friend of mine seems to be ignoring me for quite a while. In order to fight this asumption
I asked them already several times to get in contact with me. Have you ever felt to be ignored or to be ghosted in your life? If yes then you might know in which position I am currently. You constantly ask yourself whether you did something wrong or whether something changed in the others personal life, which you pick up as dislike...
It's even worse, when you think/thought they might be/have been your best friend. I strongly doubt that they read this blog, although they know of it, therefor I dont hesitate to say these things openly. The turning point might have been their birthday a few days ago, where I tried to show how important they are to me. It's all strange since. Are they all strange since? Am I all strange since? Or might I even have been strange then (at the birthday gathering)? Although I was so damn excited when I drove over there, which in the end ended in a bit of a disappointment. Maybe I was too excited and expected too much from this evening. Writing this at this exact moment comes from the fact that they are currently going out with someone that might replace me as a friend. "Left out" might also decribe it pretty well since they are obviously going to places, like a shishabar, where they refused to go with me so far. This might all just be evil thoughts in my head with no bad will from their side, but still there they are, almost like in the famous song [Mr. Brightside](https://open.spotify.com/track/003vvx7Niy0yvhvHt4a68B?si=87e10bf936d04d5b) by the killers.
In case these thoughts are not just a huge fuss I really have to question myself whether I overestimated this friendship? This FRIENDSHIP!
I really hope I am wrong...
