title: EUROPE PLS STAY!
---

Here in Germany, we see a rise of mistrust against the "European-Idea" recently. These forces would rather like to get rid of the EU and return to nationalism as it was back then at the beginning of the 20th century. Personally, I don't understand those people. Call me naive or idealistic but the European Idea for me personally is a symbol for human advancements and democracy. Yeah, the EU has its flaws and lacks but all in all I think the idea is a great one. In my opinion, we need more younge and encouraged people whose goal is to make the best out of Europe. With the Peace Nobel Price for the EU, one of the many steps in the right direction were made but there are still plenty of them ahead of us. In a world that's more globalized and populated than ever, Europe needs to be a strong center and an ambassador for humanistic ideals.

I have a dream that one day I will not just call myself a citizen of Germany but also a proud citizen of the [United States of Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_of_Europe)
To all my European fellows: Let's work and stand together!
