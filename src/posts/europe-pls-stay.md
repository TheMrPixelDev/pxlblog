title: EUROPE PLS STAY!
---

Here in Germany, we see a rise of mistrust against the “European-Idea” recently. Those who mistrust would like to get rid the EU and return to the nationalism of the early 20th century.  Personally, I don't understand those people. Call me naive or idealistic, but the European Idea for me personally is a symbol for human advancements and democracy. Yeah, the EU has its flaws, but all in all I think the idea is a great. In a world that's more globalized and populated than ever, Europe needs to be a strong center and an ambassador for humanistic ideals.

Maybe someday there will be the [United States of Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_of_Europe)
To all my European fellows: Let's work and stand together!
