title: I feel awesome! (I am awesome)
---

I am currently sitting in an Irish Pub with some friends and it might be the alcohol that forces me to think about my own life once again. To say it with Barneys words: It\''s awesome! And I do really mean it like that. I found new awesome friends recently, I got motivation to improve myself (physically and mentally) and I achieved things I never thought I could. A new song by the german artist Cro describes this feeling pretty well:\

Thank you all my friends <3
