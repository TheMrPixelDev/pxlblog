title: I <3 RaspberryPi

Everyone knows the RaspberryPi. Even this site is running this tiny computer which is beloved by everyone. In my opinion, the RaspberryPi is a tool that encourages people to take back software AND hardware into their own hands. It's a tiny symbol for the power of the maker community and possibly a huge symbol for the Linux Operation System itself. It's just damn awesome!
