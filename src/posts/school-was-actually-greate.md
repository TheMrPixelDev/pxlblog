title: School was actually f*cking greate
---

It's now about a couple of weeks since I got the results for my finals... Actually, still in the process of realizing what happened.
I am now officially in the possession of the most valuable school graduation of my country, the Abitur, and I am totally thrilled about it.
It's some kind of the same feeling I had a few years ago when I walked through the door of this specific school. I felt amazed, proud, elite and so much more... It was the school my inner self always wanted to be a part of, and now that I have to leave it successfully, it even feels kind of sad. That might not be understandable for you, but I really love my school. So much that I will always be able to tell others proudly: “This way MY school! I got my finals there!”
