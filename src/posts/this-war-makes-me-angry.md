title: This war makes me angry
---

The unimaginable happened... War within the heart of europe... For more than 70 years this was not the case. And unfortunately this time it's Russia or Putin who started this war. A guy who is arleady governing the largest country in the world. And still for him the largest country in the world large enough... It makes me sick to see people like you and me, just living their normal live, getting pulled into a war they never wanted. In my thoughts I am with them. And by the way I strongly support their President in his mission of joining the European Union. But anyway it some kind of feels like Putin is killing our european brothers and sisters... What an awful human this guy is... NO! Not a human rather a monster!
