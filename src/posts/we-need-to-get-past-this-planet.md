title: WE NEED TO GET PAST THIS PLANET
---

This title may sound a bit paradoxical since I commit myself to environmental protection measures but this also involves thinking further. And when I say further mean it. Although there is a chance we might be able to save ourselves from the destruction of our home planet, there will still be definite dangers for our species like asteroids, the death of the sun, or even possible scenarios of AI becoming too powerful. And even though these scenarios might seem quite abstract and far-fetched from a current perspective, the wish of humanity to explore, to gain space, or to spread itself throughout the universe will be there... Or at least I hope so because I do have that strong desire. 
In case you are still not convinced I encourage you to get yourself into the topic with the help of the opinion of a quite smart person that inspired me: Stephen Hawking
